# About

I'm Chris. I'm a Senior Gameplay Programmer at Rocksteady Studios, living in London. 

I used to work for Sumo Digital in Sheffield, my hometown. While I was there I helped ship these games:

<div style="display: inline-block">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/pd2.jpg" width="165" height="210" />
</div>
<div style="display: inline-block">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/cd3.jpg" width="165" height="210"/>
</div>
</div>


Before that, I studied a Masters degree in Computer Science for Games at Sheffield Hallam University.
